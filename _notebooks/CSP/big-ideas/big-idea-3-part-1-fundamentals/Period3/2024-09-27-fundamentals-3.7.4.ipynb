    "- The if statement checks if the user's health status is \"healthy.\" If this condition is true, the program will print \"You should eat an apple!\" indicating a healthy choice.\n",
    "- If the health status is not \"healthy,\" the else statement is executed. Within this block, another if statement checks if the user's health status is \"unhealthy.\" If this condition is true, the program will print \"You should eat chocolate!\"\n",
    "- Lastly, if neither condition is met when the user doesn't care about what they eat, the else statement will execute, printing \"You don't care about what you eat. How about a coffee?\" This covers the case for users who are indifferent about their food choices. Keep in mind, you can also achieve this same result using `elif statements` instead of having to create chains of `if` and `else statements`. However, it's important to note that `elif statements` are NOT nested conditionals because they form a single-level structure."
