    "In the first example, the `for` loop iterates over each element in the `colors` list. The loop goes through the list one by one, and each color is printed to the console. The loop ends after all the colors (\"red,\" \"blue,\" \"green,\" and \"yellow\") are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second example, the `for` loop iterates over the key-value pairs in the `fruits` dictionary using the `.items()` method. The loop prints the fruit name (key) along with its quantity (value). For each fruit in the dictionary—apple, banana, and cherry—the loop prints the name of the fruit followed by its quantity, such as \"apple: 3\" and so on."

    "## Additional Notes:\n",
    "- **List Iteration**: Using a `for` loop allows us to access and perform actions on each element in a list. This is useful when you have a collection of similar data, like colors or items in a store.\n",
    "- **Dictionary Iteration**: In a dictionary, a `for` loop iterates over key-value pairs using `.items()`. This is particularly useful for tasks where you need to manage related data, such as inventory lists (fruit and quantity).\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Looping over collections like lists and dictionaries is common in scenarios where you need to analyze data, summarize content, or automate tasks that involve processing multiple items."
