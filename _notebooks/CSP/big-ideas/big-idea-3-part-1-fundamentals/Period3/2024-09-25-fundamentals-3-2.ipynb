    "    Data types are classifications that specify what kind of data a variable can hold. In programming, knowing and using the right data types is critical for processing data accurately. In this lesson, we are going over strings, lists, integers, floating-point numbers, tuples, dictionaries, booleans, and sets. These different data types allow computers to represent real-world information (e.g., using strings to store text, integers for counting, booleans for binary conditions).\n",
