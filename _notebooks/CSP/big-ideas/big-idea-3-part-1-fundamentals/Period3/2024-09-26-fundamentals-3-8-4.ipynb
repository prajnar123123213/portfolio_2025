    "# Basic Overview:\n",
    "- A **while loop** is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.\n",
    "- This type of loop is particularly useful for tasks like counting, accumulating values, or continuing until a particular condition is met.\n",
    "- In this lesson, the while loop is demonstrated to display a message with a count from 1 to 3."

    "- We start with the variable **count** set to 1.\n",
    "- The loop checks if **count** is less than or equal to 3, and as long as this condition is true, the code inside the loop runs.\n",
    "- On each iteration, the current message number is printed, and **count** is incremented by 1.\n",
    "- Once **count** exceeds 3, the condition becomes false, and the loop terminates."

    "# Additional Notes:\n",
    "- **Infinite Loops:** Care must be taken to ensure that the condition in the loop will eventually become false; otherwise, it could result in an infinite loop that never stops.\n",
    "- **Practical Use Cases:** While loops are great for situations where the number of iterations isn't known ahead of time, like reading data until the end of a file or waiting for specific user input.\n",
    "- **Common Pitfall:** A common mistake is forgetting to update the loop control variable (like **count** in this case), which can cause an infinite loop if the condition never becomes false."
