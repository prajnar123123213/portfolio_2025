    "In this lesson, we learn how to iterate over a list using loops. A list is a collection of items, and a loop allows us to access each item one by one. In this example, we use a `for` loop to iterate over a list of numbers, and the loop prints each number from the list. The same concept can be applied to any collection, such as a list of favorite foods, which you can display using a loop."

    "## Additional Notes:\n",
    "- **Lists**: A list is a sequence of items stored together in a single variable. You can store numbers, strings, or even other lists inside a list.\n",
    "- **For Loop**: The `for` loop is commonly used to iterate over elements in a collection, such as a list. This loop automatically moves through the collection, one item at a time, until all items have been processed.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Iterating over a list is helpful when you need to perform the same operation on each item, like printing, modifying, or checking conditions."
